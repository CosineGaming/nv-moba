VANAGLORIA (working title)
==========================

> A team game with an emphasis on movement (with no shooting), inspired by Overwatch and Zineth

Main mechanics ideas:

- [x] Teams start side-by-side and must get to objective
- [x] Objective is a see-saw: have more mass on your side of point

Side mechanics ideas:

- [ ] Maze-like map
- [x] After enough movement, player can switch characters (switching is a mechanic, not a meta-game! no one-tricks)
- [x] Speed up slowly over time. Reset on switch

Current heroes:

- Active:
  - Wallriding mfer
- Offensive:
  - WallMAKING mfer
  - An ATTRACTIVE mfer
- Support:
  - Margarine

Ideas for Heroes:

- More active
  - Blink (Tracer) - no cooldown, but loses all speed on hitting walls
  - Heavy guy - Slow, but very heavy for the see-saw
  - Climb and glide abilities
- More supportive
  - Boost - Area of effect or zarya-like cast, speeds people up
  - Flop - Changes side of see-saw for each team (should it be mechanic instead??)
  - Build - Build Zineth-like rails for anyone to use
  - Teleportation - (for others! or maybe including the enemy too!)
  - Portal 2-like gels (bounce, speed, slow?)
- More offensive
  - Lay walls
  - Lay traps
  - Destroy buildings
  - Slow in AoE

Key concepts:

- From mobas we take:
  - An emphasis on teamwork (Objective-based is a plus)
  - Rich, emergent interaction
  - Quick battles (very high replay value)
- From Zineth we take:
  - A rethinking of racing games
  - High skill cap, low skill floor
  - Forgiving gameplay
