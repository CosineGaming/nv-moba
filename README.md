A Nonviolent MOBA
=================

> A team game with an emphasis on movement (with no shooting), inspired by Overwatch and Zineth

Main mechanics ideas:

- Teams start side-by-side and must get to objective
- Objective is a see-saw: have more mass on your side of point

Side mechanics ideas:

- Maze-like map
- After enough movement, player can switch characters (switching is a mechanic, not a meta-game! no one-tricks)
- Speed up slowly over time. Reset on switch

Ideas for characters:

- More active
  - Blink (Tracer) - no cooldown, but loses all speed on hitting walls
  - Heavy guy - Slow, but very heavy for the see-saw
  - Flying, of course
- More supportive
  - Merge - combines with someone to boost their speed
  - Boost - Area of effect or zarya-like cast, speeds people up
  - Flop - Changes side of see-saw for each team (should it be mechanic instead??)
  - Build - Build Zineth-like rails for anyone to use
  - Teleportation - (for others! or maybe including the enemy too!)
- More offensive
  - Lay walls
  - Lay traps
  - Destroy buildings
  - Slow in AoE

Key concepts:

- From mobas we take:
  - An emphasis on teamwork (Objective-based is a plus)
  - Rich, emergent interaction
  - Quick battles (very high replay value)
- From Zineth we take:
  - A rethinking of racing games
  - High skill cap, low skill floor
  - Forgiving gameplay
