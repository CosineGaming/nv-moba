A Nonviolent MOBA
=================

> A team game with an emphasis on movement (with no shooting), inspired by Overwatch and Zineth

Main mechanics ideas:

- Teams start side-by-side and must get to objective
- Objective is a see-saw: have more mass on your side of point

Side mechanics ideas:

- Maze-like map
- After enough movement, player can switch characters (switching is a mechanic, not a meta-game! no one-tricks)
- Speed up slowly over time. Reset on switch

Ideas for characters:

- Blink (Tracer) - no cooldown, but loses all speed on hitting walls
- Merge (Mercy) - combines with someone to boost their speed
- Amp it up (Lucio/Zarya) - Area of effect or zarya-like cast, speeds people up
- Changes side of see-saw for each team (should it be mechanic instead??)
- Build Zineth-like rails for anyone to use
- Teleportation (for others!), like Symettra (but faster pace)
- Heavy guy - Slow, but very heavy for the see-saw

Key concepts:

- From mobas we take:

  - An emphasis on teamwork (Objective-based is a plus)
  - Rich, emergent interaction
  - Quick battles (very high replay value)

- From Zineth we take:
  - A rethinking of racing games
  - High skill cap, low skill floor
  - Forgiving gameplay
