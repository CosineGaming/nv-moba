All TODO / design direction that's not in the README
====================================================

Big TODOs:

- Keep implementing more heroes
- Figure out how to make things seem more fast-paced
- ^ I think you need more abilities for heroes, that combine well
  - Like, you could combine PAZIENZA with [destroys buildings]
- Start making maps and figuring out what works / what you like
  - I'd love to do a payload map!
  - More platforming for everyone (It's industria only rn tbh)
  - Give portals a tilted wall to fuck with acceleration
    - Change portal mechanics to be more PortalTM-y?
- Make a real user interface
  - Menu 1: (Play Game, and Custom Game) Custom -> Current menu
- Voice chat
- Auto-update :(((((

Smaller TODOs:

- Too much time "waiting" - too hard to get to objective
- Art?
  - Particles - wall destruction, wallriding
- Ira is OP?
  - Nerfed - 5 walls
- Make motion more reactive?
- Grab someone and draw an impulse on them
  - Combine with SUPERBIA, use charge to build portals

Bugs:

Landmarks:

- When you have a workable demo: @mention @turion@mastodon.art
- As soon as you can auto-update, have matchmaking, and it's playable, release on CG
- As soon as you think it's a fun game and can handle the load, post on reddit

Design ideas too long for the README:
